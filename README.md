Projecte 2n Semestre - Disseny i Programaci√≥ Orientat a Objectes, Curs 2020-21

## Description
This is my 2nd project working with Java and object-oriented programming, first one with UI (Swing), it was developed by me and my colleagues Albert Clarimon, Christian Hasko, Pau Santacreu abd Albert Garangou. Being the second one, it is obvious that there are things to improve but, in general, I am happy with the results.

Project requirements, database structure and final report can be found in the NO-CODI folder.

**Note:** I know there is a database login and password in resources/config.json, the database server was created only for development purpose and was deleted in July 2021. Nothing to worry about.
